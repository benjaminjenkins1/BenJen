Hello, my name is Benjamin Jenkins. I'm a software development student at Marist College with a passion for technology. When I'm not in class I enjoy gaming, coding, and playing volleyball. Lately I've been using Node, Express, and React to build webapps, and am currently building a chess engine in Java that uses node-java to interact with a React-based frontend. For the past few months I've been working at Marist in our Web Services department.

You can find me on [facebook](http://facebook.com/bbenkins), [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-jenkins-44086bb7/), and of course [github](https://github.com/benjaminjenkins1).
