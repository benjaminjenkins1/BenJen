<h1>Jekyll From Scratch</h1>
If youre like me and would rather not represent yourself with someone else's work, you might not like the idea of using a prebuilt theme for your blog or personal webpage. This means that if you ever do want to set up a blog, you get to experience the joys of learning the inner workings of the platform. I had used WordPress in the past and enjoyed the polished feel, but I didn't need nearly everything it offered so I turned to Jekyll, a simple but powerful CMS that excels at hosting static sites. In this post I go through what it takes to turn a bank-slate Jekyll site into your own unique creation.
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>First, you obviously need to get everything installed. Rather than type out a lengthy instalation guide here, I’ll point you to <a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-jekyll-plus-a-free-bootstrap-3-starter-theme">Scotch.io’s excellent installation guide</a>. Stop when you get to the “Getting Started” section, because <code>jekyll new my-blog</code> will add the default theme to your site, and that’s not what we want.</p>

<p>Instead, to set up a blank slate site, type <code>jekyll new your-blog-name --blank</code>. This will create a new folder in the current directory with the most barebones site possible. It’s so barebones it doesn’t even have a config file, so that’s what we’ll do first.</p>

<p>Note: Now would also be a good time to set this directory up as a git repository.</p>

<p>Make a new file in the root directory of your new site called <code>_config.yml</code>. Windows: <code>tpye nul &gt; _config.yml</code> Bash: <code>touch _config.yml</code>. Right now we’ll just add a few basic necesseties, like where Jekyll should look for layouts, and pages other than your blog posts, like “about me” or “portfolio’ pages.</p>

<p>Add this to your _config.yml:</p>
<pre><code>  # Where things are
  source:      .
  destination: ./_site
  plugins_dir: ./_plugins
  layouts_dir: ./_layouts
  data_dir:    ./_data
  
  include ['_pages']
</code></pre>

<p>Now go add some stuff the index.html file in your site’s root directory so that something shows up once we build the site.</p>

<p>Build the side by running <code>jekyll b</code> at your site’s root. It will make a folder called _site . This contains the ready-to-serve files. You can start a super-useful dev-server that rebuilds the page whenever you make changes by running <code>jekyll s</code>.</p>

<p>if you navigate to the address of the Jekyll dev-server, you’ll see the contents of your index.html file. It’s probably a lbit boring right now, unless you went crazy on the “add some stuff” step. To start turning this into a functional blog, we’ll have to add a few more folders to its root directory. Make folders called _pages and _includes. _pages will hold the non-post pages I mentioned earlier, and “includes” will hold stuff like headers, footers, and any other elements you’ll want to reuse several times on your site. It’s also a good idea to make a folder called “_data” and indide it make a file called global.yml. This file holds sitewide data like the site’s URL, title, and author information, for use in your pages. It should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code># Site Settings
title: 'BenJen'
description: "The blog of Benjamin Jenkins. Theres some neat stuff here, 
or at least I think so."
url: 'http://benjen.me' # the base hostname &amp; protocol for your site

# Admin Settings
admin_name: 'Benjamin Jenkins'
admin_email: 'ben@benjen.me'
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-funner-stuff">The Fun(ner) Stuff</h2>

<p>Now it’s time to start making the site look like a site. Make a new file in the _layouts folder called header.html, and another called footer.html . Thhe contents of these files will show up wherever you use the relevant  {% include somefile.html %}  tag, likely in your layouts, which we’ll get to next.</p>
