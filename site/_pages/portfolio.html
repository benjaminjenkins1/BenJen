<center>Here are a few of the things I've made.</center>
<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="applause---python-postgresql"><a href="https://applauseapp.io">Applause</a> - Python, PostgreSQL</h3>
<p>A clap-based analytics and approval tracking tool. Create an account and add a script to your articles that will track page views and top referrers on your site, and add a button that allows your users to “clap” for the article. View reports on the data generated in your daashboard, and get a better understanding of which of your articles people like most, as well as where your traffic is coming from.</p>

<h3 id="benos---6502-emulator-and-os----typescript"><a href="http://benjen.me/webapps/6502/index.html">BenOS - 6502 Emulator and OS</a>  - TypeScript</h3>
<p>Browser-based emulator and operating system using an <a href="http://labouseur.com/commondocs/6502alan-instruction-set.pdf">instruction set</a> based on that of the 6502 microprocessor. Features include a console, shell, filesystem, and more!</p>

<h3 id="magic-frame---python-sqlite"><a href="https://github.com/benjaminjenkins1/magic_frame">Magic Frame</a> - Python, SQLite</h3>
<p>My attempt at a smart photo frame system. Users create accounts with just a phone number (SMS integration with Twilio!), and upload photos that are displayed on a frame in their home and in frames owned by users they are friends with. The frame application is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, and runs a discovery server and the photo display. A user uses the web application to discover and claim a frame on their network, to add friends, and upload photos.</p>

<h3 id="marist-writing-advisor---php-javascript-python"><a href="http://wa.marist.ai">Marist Writing Advisor</a> - PHP, Javascript, Python</h3>
<p>The Marist Writing Advisor is a web application designed to help students improve the quality of thier writing. It uses a sentence processing system designed by my professor at Marist, Pablo Rivas, to evaluate the quality of sentences based on a set of rules developed by the English department at Marist. It also uses the Watson Natural Language Understanding API’s to provide ancillary feedback on a student’s writing, including information on the language, tone, and personality of their writing. After developing the prototype interface for this application with IBM Joint Study, I continued work on this system with a team of other students as my Capstone project. You’ll need a Marist account to access this tool.</p>

<h3 id="mymovielist-api---golang-postgresql"><a href="https://github.com/benjaminjenkins1/MyMovieList">MyMovieList API</a> - Golang, PostgreSQL</h3>
<p>A JSON API designed for keeping track of a list of movies you want to watch. Written in Go, this API integrates Google’s and Facebook’s OAuth2 authentication services and uses Redis as its session store. I had planned to build a mobile app to consume this API, but that’s been put on hold for now. I might revisit it in the future, though.</p>

<h3 id="limbo-lost--found---php-mysql"><a href="https://github.com/benjaminjenkins1/limbo">Limbo Lost &amp; Found</a> - PHP, MySQL</h3>
<p>One of my first software development projects which can be described as a complete system. This web application allows users to create an account, then log in and provide information about items they have either lost or found on the Marist campus. It also allows users to claim an item and provides a means to get in touch with the person who found it.</p>
